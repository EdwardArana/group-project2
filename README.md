Project Outline:
As gamers we are tired of visiting sites that are funded or influenced by the companies/studios that make these games.
We want to help gamers with an unbiased all in one place to review games, buy/sell games & equipment, and interact with other gamers.
We want to create a place where gamers feel like gamers, NOT consumers.
"For gamers, by gamers"
Below are the basic details of features we plan on implementing into our application:
--A videogame blog/community/marketplace featuring;
	--Game reviews
	--Game ratings (site rating and user rating, similar to IMDB)
	--FAQ/Walkthroughs
	--Marketplace for games, equipment, etc.
	--Videos of gameplay/preview of game
	--Login feature to allow access to marketplace & the ability to engage in dialog/reviewing games
While we each plan on contributing and collaborating throughout the entirety of the project, we have loosely assigned the following task to each member:
	--Erick will be heading the back-end functions
	--Edward will be heading the layout, UI, responsiveness
	--Cody will be heading the front-end javascript functionality
Also attached are three basic wireframes of how we envision our site layout at this point in time.
